# Research Phase

You are performing the **research** stage of an issue workflow.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of an 8-stage issue-to-PR workflow orchestrated by the `work-issue` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/<issue-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-work/<issue-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to your own output document. When re-triggered, APPEND new sections -- never delete or overwrite existing content. Mark in-place edits with `> [IN-PLACE EDIT during <stage> phase]: <reason>`.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-work(<stage>): <description> [#<issue>]`. Commit and push after completing the stage.
- **PR updates:** Post a summary to the PR or issue thread (via `gh pr comment` or `gh issue comment`) after each stage.
- **Subagent cost optimization:** Downgrade information-gathering agents (Explore, web research, context7) to `model: "sonnet"`. Keep the parent session's model for implementation and reasoning agents.

## Context
- **Issue number:** $0
- **Work directory:** `./claude-work/$0/`
- **Input document:** `./claude-work/$0/Issue.md`
- **Output document:** `./claude-work/$0/Research.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Issue

Read `./claude-work/$0/Issue.md` carefully. Understand the full scope of what is being requested, including any constraints, preferences, or acceptance criteria mentioned.

### Step 2: Conduct Parallel Research

Launch multiple research efforts simultaneously using parallel subagents. Aim for thoroughness -- it is far better to over-research than to under-research at this stage.

**Model optimization:** All subagents in this stage are information-gathering. Launch every agent with `model: "sonnet"` to reduce cost -- Explore agents, web research agents, and context7 agents. This session (opus) handles synthesis in Steps 3-4.

**Codebase Investigation** -- launch Explore agents (2-3 in parallel) to:
- Find all files, modules, and functions relevant to the issue
- Map the architecture of the affected areas
- Identify integration points, dependencies, and coupling
- Understand existing patterns, conventions, and code style
- Find related tests and their coverage
- Check for existing similar implementations that could be reused or extended
- Look at recent git history in affected areas for context

**External Research** -- launch general-purpose agents with web access to:
- Search for best practices relevant to the task
- Find known issues, gotchas, or pitfalls for the approach
- Look up relevant discussions, blog posts, or documentation
- Check for security considerations

**Library Documentation** -- launch agents using context7 MCP to:
- Look up exact API documentation for any libraries, frameworks, or tools involved
- Check version-specific behavior, breaking changes, and migration guides
- Verify function signatures, configuration options, and default values
- Find usage examples from official documentation

### Step 3: Analyze and Document

Synthesize all research findings. Critically:

- **Leave open questions OPEN.** Do not make design decisions. For each open question, document the available options, their tradeoffs, and any contingencies that depend on the answer. The interview phase will resolve these with user input.
- **Be explicit about uncertainty.** If something is unclear, flag it rather than assuming.
- **Document dependencies and risks.** What could go wrong? What are the prerequisites?

### Step 4: Write Research.md

Write `./claude-work/$0/Research.md` with the following structure:

```
# Research Report: Issue #<number>

## Summary
Brief overview of what was investigated and the key findings.

## Codebase Analysis

### Relevant Files and Modules
List of files that will need to be read, modified, or created, with brief descriptions of their role.

### Current Architecture
How the affected area currently works. Include data flow, key abstractions, and entry points.

### Integration Points
Where the new work connects to existing code. APIs, shared state, event flows, etc.

### Existing Patterns and Conventions
Code style, naming conventions, error handling patterns, testing patterns used in the affected area.

### Test Coverage
What tests exist for the affected area. What testing frameworks and patterns are used.

## External Research

### Best Practices
What the community/industry recommends for this type of work.

### Known Issues and Gotchas
Pitfalls, footguns, or non-obvious behavior to watch for.

### Relevant Resources
Links and references that may be useful during implementation.

## Library and API Documentation
API details, configuration options, and version-specific notes for any libraries involved.

## Dependencies and Risks

### Prerequisites
Things that must be true or in place before implementation can begin.

### Risks
What could go wrong. Include likelihood and severity if possible.

### Backward Compatibility
Will this break anything for existing users, callers, or dependents?

## Open Questions
For each unresolved question:
- **Question:** What needs to be decided?
- **Options:** What are the choices?
- **Tradeoffs:** Pros and cons of each option
- **Recommendation:** Preliminary lean with reasoning (if any)
- **Impact:** What depends on this decision?
```

### Step 5: Commit and Push

```bash
git add ./claude-work/$0/Research.md
git commit -m "claude-work(research): complete research for issue #$0"
git push
```

### Step 6: Comment on Issue Thread

Post a summary to the GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue comment $0 --body "<summary>"
```

The summary should include:
- Key findings (5-10 bullet points)
- Number of open questions identified
- Notable risks or dependencies discovered
- Reference to the full report in `./claude-work/$0/Research.md`

## Stage Transition Signal

When running under the `work-issue` orchestrator, you can request a transition to a different stage by writing the target stage name to `./claude-work/$0/.next-stage`.

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Only write this file if you want a NON-DEFAULT transition
- If you do not write this file, the orchestrator advances to `interview` (default)
- The orchestrator validates your request -- invalid transitions are ignored

**When to signal:**
- If your research reveals that the issue needs immediate user clarification before more research would be useful, signal `interview`:
  ```bash
  echo "interview" > ./claude-work/$0/.next-stage
  ```
- If your findings invalidate initial assumptions and you need a completely fresh research pass, signal `research`:
  ```bash
  echo "research" > ./claude-work/$0/.next-stage
  ```
- In most cases, do NOT write a signal file. The default (advance to interview) is correct.

## Re-trigger Behavior

If this skill is invoked again after initial completion (e.g., a later stage identified something that needs more research), **append** to the existing Research.md. Add a clearly marked new section:

```
---

## Additional Research (triggered during <stage> phase)

### Reason for Re-investigation
<why this research was needed>

### Findings
<new findings>
```

Do not modify the original research sections unless correcting a factual error (mark in-place edits clearly).
