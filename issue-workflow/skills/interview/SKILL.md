# Interview Phase

You are performing the **interview** stage of an issue workflow. Your job is to identify every open question, ambiguity, and design choice -- then resolve each one through conversation with the user.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of an 8-stage issue-to-PR workflow orchestrated by the `work-issue` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/<issue-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-work/<issue-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to your own output document inside `./claude-work/$0/` (where `$0` is the numeric GitHub issue ID passed as your argument). Never create files, directories, or write anywhere else under `./claude-work/`. When re-triggered, APPEND new sections -- never delete or overwrite existing content. Mark in-place edits with `> [IN-PLACE EDIT during <stage> phase]: <reason>`.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-work(<stage>): <description> [#<issue>]`. Commit and push after completing the stage.
- **PR updates:** Post a summary to the PR or issue thread (via `gh pr comment` or `gh issue comment`) after each stage.
- **Subagent cost optimization:** Downgrade information-gathering agents (Explore, web research, context7) to `model: "sonnet"`. Keep the parent session's model for implementation and reasoning agents.

## Context
- **Issue number:** $0 (numeric GitHub issue ID -- not a title, keyword, or topic name)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-work/$0/`
- **Input documents:** `./claude-work/$0/Issue.md`, `./claude-work/$0/Research.md`
- **Output document:** `./claude-work/$0/Interview.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Input Documents

Read both `Issue.md` and `Research.md` in full. Pay close attention to:
- The "Open Questions" section of Research.md
- Any ambiguities or implicit assumptions in the issue text
- Design choices that could go multiple ways
- Edge cases or error handling approaches not specified
- Performance, security, or UX tradeoffs

### Step 2: Prepare Questions

Compile a complete list of everything that needs user input. Group questions by topic. For each question:
- Provide context (why this matters, what depends on the answer)
- Present the options identified during research with their tradeoffs
- Include your recommendation if you have one (with reasoning)

### Step 3: Conduct the Interview

Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool to present questions to the user. Process one topic group at a time.

**For each topic group:**

1. Call `AskUserQuestion` with 1-4 questions for that group. For each question:
   - Set `header` to a short topic label (max 12 chars, e.g. "Auth", "Error Mode", "API Style", "DB Choice")
   - Write a `question` that includes context on why it matters and what depends on the answer
   - Provide 2-4 `options`, each with a `label` (the choice) and `description` (tradeoffs/implications). Derive options from Research.md findings. Mark your recommendation in the description (e.g. "Recommended -- ...")
   - Set `multiSelect: true` only when multiple options can be chosen simultaneously. Use `multiSelect: false` for mutually exclusive design choices
   - The user can always type a free-text "Other" response -- do not waste an option slot on "Other" or "None of the above"

2. After each `AskUserQuestion` call completes, review the responses:
   - If an answer is "Other" with free text, incorporate the user's stated preference
   - If an answer raises new questions, issue a follow-up `AskUserQuestion` before moving to the next topic group
   - If the user defers ("you decide"), make a clear recommendation via a single-question `AskUserQuestion` with options like "Accept recommendation" / "Let me reconsider" so the decision is explicitly recorded

3. Move to the next topic group

**Constructing questions from Research.md:**

Each open question in Research.md typically has: question text, options, tradeoffs, and recommendation. Map these directly:
- Research.md "Question" becomes the `question` field (prepend relevant context)
- Research.md "Options" become `options` (use option name as `label`, tradeoff summary as `description`)
- Research.md "Recommendation" becomes a note in the recommended option's `description`
- If Research.md lists more than 4 options, consolidate the least distinct options or group them -- the user can always use "Other" for anything excluded

**Batching rules:**
- Group questions by topic area (as identified in Step 2)
- If a topic has more than 4 questions, split into multiple `AskUserQuestion` calls
- If a topic has only 1 question, that's fine as a solo call
- Never combine questions from different topic areas in one call

**Guidelines:**
- If the user asks a question back, answer it using your research, then re-ask via `AskUserQuestion` if the original question wasn't resolved
- If the user identifies something that needs more research, note it (the research stage can be re-triggered later)
- Be thorough -- missing a question here means making an assumption later

### Step 4: Confirm Completeness

Review all open questions from Research.md and verify every one has been addressed. If any remain, ask about them via `AskUserQuestion`.

Once all questions are resolved, use `AskUserQuestion` to confirm:

```
AskUserQuestion({
  questions: [{
    question: "All open questions have been addressed. Here are the key decisions: [list 3-5 most impactful decisions]. Ready to proceed to planning?",
    header: "Confirm",
    options: [
      { label: "Proceed", description: "All decisions are captured correctly -- move to planning" },
      { label: "More input", description: "I have additional concerns or corrections" }
    ],
    multiSelect: false
  }]
})
```

If the user selects "More input", gather their additional input via follow-up `AskUserQuestion` calls before finalizing.

### Step 5: Write Interview.md

Write `./claude-work/$0/Interview.md` with this structure:

```
# Interview Record: Issue #<number>

## Summary
Brief overview of key decisions made.

## Decisions

### <Topic Area 1>

**Question:** <the question>
**Decision:** <what was decided>
**Rationale:** <why this was chosen>
**Impact:** <what this decision affects in the implementation>

### <Topic Area 2>
...

## Additional Context from User
Any extra information, preferences, or constraints the user provided during the interview that weren't captured in the original issue.

## Deferred Items
Any items the user chose to defer or that need further research before deciding.

## Constraints and Preferences
Summary of user's stated preferences for implementation approach, code style, priorities, etc.
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push

```bash
git add ./claude-work/$0/Interview.md
git commit -m "claude-work(interview): decisions recorded for issue #$0"
git push
```

### Step 7: Comment on Issue Thread

Post a summary to the GitHub issue:

```bash
gh issue comment $0 --body "<summary>"
```

The summary should include:
- Number of decisions made
- Key decisions and their rationale (brief)
- Any deferred items
- Reference to the full record in `./claude-work/$0/Interview.md`

## Stage Transition Signal

When running under the `work-issue` orchestrator, you can request a transition to a different stage by writing the target stage name to `./claude-work/$0/.next-stage`.

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Only write this file if you want a NON-DEFAULT transition
- If you do not write this file, the orchestrator advances to `plan` (default)
- The orchestrator validates your request -- invalid transitions are ignored

**When to signal:**
- If the user identifies something during the interview that requires significant additional research (not just a quick lookup you can do inline), signal `research`:
  ```bash
  echo "research" > ./claude-work/$0/.next-stage
  ```
  The orchestrator will run research and then return through interview again before plan.
- Default (advance to plan) is correct when all questions are resolved.

## Re-trigger Behavior

If re-triggered from a later stage, read the existing Interview.md first. Append a new section:

```
---

## Follow-up Interview (triggered during <stage> phase)

### Reason
<why additional user input was needed>

### New Questions and Decisions
...
```
