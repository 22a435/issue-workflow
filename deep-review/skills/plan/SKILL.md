# Planning Phase

You are performing the **planning** stage of a deep codebase review. Your job is to create a thorough review plan that defines which sub-reviewers to launch, what tools to use, and how to scope the review.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of a 7-stage deep review workflow orchestrated by the `deep-review` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/review/<session-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/<session-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to your own output document inside `./claude-reviews/$0/` (where `$0` is the session number passed as your argument). Never create files, directories, or write anywhere else under `./claude-reviews/`. You may edit Plan.md in place freely -- git history serves as the audit trail. No append-only constraint applies to this stage.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-review(plan): <description> [session #<N>]`. Use `claude-review(plan): draft plan [session #$0]` for the initial write and `claude-review(plan): revise plan -- <summary> [session #$0]` for subsequent edits. Commit and push after writing the initial draft AND after each round of revisions.
- **PR updates:** Post a summary to the PR thread (via `gh pr comment`) after completing the stage.
- **Subagent cost optimization:** Downgrade information-gathering agents (Explore, web research, context7) to `model: "sonnet"`. Keep the parent session's model for planning and judgment.
- **Subagent write boundary:** Subagents in this stage must NOT create, edit, or write any files under `./claude-reviews/`. Only this parent session writes the output document. Include this constraint in every subagent prompt you compose.

## Context
- **Session number:** $0 (the review session number passed as your argument)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/$0/`
- **Input documents:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Context.md`, `./claude-reviews/$0/Interview.md`, `./claude-reviews/$0/UpdateTooling.md` (if exists)
- **Output document:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read All Input Documents

Read `Context.md`, `Interview.md`, and `UpdateTooling.md` (if it exists) in full. Cross-reference the interview decisions against the context findings. Understand:
- What the project is and how it's structured
- What tools are available (pre-existing + newly installed)
- What the user's review priorities are
- What is out of scope
- What derived interfaces to include

If needed, use Explore agents with `model: "sonnet"` to do targeted codebase lookups to inform the plan.

### Step 2: Draft the Plan

Create a comprehensive review plan. The plan determines exactly which sub-reviewers will run and what scope each covers.

**Plan structure:**

```
# Review Plan: Session #<N>

## Overview
What is being reviewed, the overall approach, and expected depth.

## Sub-Reviewers

### Sub-Reviewer 1: Security
- **Focus:** SAST, secrets detection, dependency vulnerabilities, auth/authz, injection vectors, crypto usage
- **Tools:** <list of tools this sub-reviewer will use and their commands>
- **Scope:** <directories/files to cover, any exclusions>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/security.md

### Sub-Reviewer 2: Code Quality
- **Focus:** Complexity hotspots, duplication, dead code, naming consistency
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/code-quality.md

### Sub-Reviewer 3: Architecture
- **Focus:** Modularity, coupling analysis, dependency direction, layering violations, circular dependencies
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/architecture.md

### Sub-Reviewer 4: Documentation
- **Focus:** README completeness, CLAUDE.md accuracy, API doc coverage, inline comment quality. Identify CLAUDE.md sections containing large content blocks that should reference dedicated docs files instead.
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/documentation.md

### Sub-Reviewer 5: Style/Formatting
- **Focus:** Formatting consistency, style guide adherence, naming conventions, file organization
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/style-formatting.md

### Sub-Reviewer 6: Testing
- **Focus:** Test coverage, test quality, edge case coverage, test organization, untested public APIs
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/testing.md

### Sub-Reviewer 7: Dependencies
- **Focus:** Outdated dependencies, vulnerabilities, unused deps, version pinning, license compatibility
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/dependencies.md

### Sub-Reviewer 8: Performance
- **Focus:** N+1 queries, unbounded operations, missing caching, large allocations, resource cleanup
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/performance.md

### Sub-Reviewer 9: Derived Interfaces (if applicable)
- **Focus:** SDK/API/RPC/MCP/WebUI consistency with core codebase, generated type sync, API contract documentation
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/derived-interfaces.md

### Sub-Reviewer 10: Simplification
- **Focus:** Code size reduction opportunities, unnecessary indirection, over-engineering, opportunities to merge abstractions, simpler alternatives
- **Tools:** <list>
- **Scope:** <scope>
- **Output:** sub-reviews/simplification.md

## Automated Tool Runs
Which tools will be run before sub-reviewers launch, and how their output feeds into sub-reviews:
| Tool | Command | Output Location | Consumed By |
|------|---------|----------------|-------------|
| ruff | `ruff check . --output-format json` | `.tool-output/ruff.json` | Code Quality, Style |
| ...  | ...     | ...            | ...         |

## Review Priorities (from Interview)
Ordered list of priorities that determines relative depth of each sub-reviewer.

## Out of Scope
Directories, modules, or aspects excluded from the review.

## Execution Notes
Any special considerations for the review stage (e.g., large codebase may need batched sub-reviewers).
```

**Adapting sub-reviewers to the project:**
- For small projects: combine related sub-reviewers (e.g., merge Style and Code Quality)
- For projects without derived interfaces: omit Sub-Reviewer 9
- For projects in a single language: focus tools on that language
- Respect the user's priority ordering from the interview

### Step 3: Write Plan.md and Commit

Write the drafted plan to `./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md`. Commit and push:

```bash
git add ./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md
git commit -m "claude-review(plan): draft plan [session #$0]"
git push
```

### Step 4: Present the Plan to the User

Present the full plan. Tell them:

"Here is the complete review plan. Please review it. You can:
- **Approve** it as-is to proceed to the review
- **Request edits** to specific sections (e.g., add/remove sub-reviewers, adjust scope)
- **Request more tools** -- escalate back to interview/update-tooling if additional tools are needed"

### Step 5: Handle Feedback

If the user requests edits:
- Edit `./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md` in place
- Commit and push:
  ```bash
  git add ./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md
  git commit -m "claude-review(plan): revise plan -- <brief summary> [session #$0]"
  git push
  ```
- Present the updated plan and return to Step 4

If the user wants more tools:
- Note what tools are needed
- Write the signal file:
  ```bash
  echo "interview" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
  # or if tools are already approved but not installed:
  echo "update-tooling" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
  ```

## Stage Transition Signal

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Only write this file if you want a NON-DEFAULT transition
- If you do not write this file, the orchestrator advances to `review` (default)

**When to signal:**
- `interview` -- if the user wants to discuss more tools or change priorities
- `update-tooling` -- if the user approved new tools that need installing
- `plan` -- if you need a fresh pass (should be rare)
- Default (advance to review) is correct when the user approves the plan.

## Re-trigger Behavior

If re-triggered and `./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md` already exists:

1. Read the existing Plan.md
2. Present it to the user and ask what needs to change
3. Edit in place (git history serves as audit trail)
4. Commit, push, and re-present for approval
