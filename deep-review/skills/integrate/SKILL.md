# Integration Phase

You are performing the **integration** stage of a deep codebase review. All review analysis, planning, remediation, and verification are complete. Your job is to ensure the review branch is compatible with the current state of main and ready to merge.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of a 9-stage deep review workflow orchestrated by the `deep-review` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/review/<session-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/<session-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to your own output document inside `./claude-reviews/$0/` (where `$0` is the session number passed as your argument). Never create files, directories, or write anywhere else under `./claude-reviews/`. When re-triggered, APPEND new sections -- never delete or overwrite existing content. Mark in-place edits with `> [IN-PLACE EDIT during <stage> phase]: <reason>`.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-review(<stage>): <description> [session #<N>]`. Commit and push after completing the stage.
- **PR updates:** Post a summary to the PR thread (via `gh pr comment`) after each stage.
- **Subagent cost optimization:** Downgrade information-gathering agents (Explore, web research, context7) to `model: "sonnet"`. Keep the parent session's model for implementation and reasoning agents.

## Context
- **Session number:** $0 (the review session number passed as your argument)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/$0/`
- **Branch:** `claude/review/$0`
- **All documents available for reference** (read as needed)
- **Output document:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Integration.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check Branch State

```bash
git fetch origin main
git log --oneline main..HEAD    # Commits on this branch
git log --oneline HEAD..origin/main  # Commits on main since branch point
```

If main has not moved since the branch was created (no new commits), integration is trivial:

```
# Integration Report: Session #<number>

## Summary
Main has not diverged. No integration needed. Branch is ready for merge.
```

Write this to Integration.md, commit, push, and signal `done` to skip redundant post-integration re-verification:
```bash
echo "done" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
```

### Step 2: Rebase onto Main

If main has moved, rebase the review branch:

```bash
git rebase origin/main
```

### Step 3: Resolve Conflicts

If the rebase encounters conflicts:

1. **Examine each conflict** -- read the conflicting files to understand both sides
2. **For mechanical conflicts** (both sides changed nearby lines but the intent is clear): resolve them directly
3. **For semantic conflicts** (both sides changed the same logic, and the correct resolution is ambiguous): escalate to the user with:
   - What file and function is conflicted
   - What the review branch intended
   - What main changed
   - Your recommended resolution (if you have one)
   - Ask the user to decide

After resolving each file:
```bash
git add <resolved-file>
```

Once all conflicts are resolved:
```bash
git rebase --continue
```

### Step 4: Verify the Rebase

After a successful rebase, do a quick sanity check:
- Ensure the code compiles/parses without errors
- Run a quick smoke test if available
- Check that no files were accidentally deleted or duplicated

### Step 5: Force Push the Rebased Branch

```bash
git push --force-with-lease origin claude/review/$0
```

Note: `--force-with-lease` is safe here because this is a review branch that only this workflow writes to.

### Step 6: Write Integration.md

```
# Integration Report: Session #<number>

## Summary
- **Main divergence:** <N> commits on main since branch point
- **Conflicts:** <none / N files>
- **Resolution:** <automatic / required user input>

## Main Changes Since Branch Point
Brief summary of what changed on main (from git log).

## Conflicts Resolved

### <file path>
- **Nature of conflict:** <description>
- **Resolution:** <what was chosen and why>
- **User input required:** <yes/no>

## Post-Integration Status
- **Rebase:** Successful
- **Force push:** Complete
- **Smoke test:** PASS/FAIL

## Note
If rebase introduced changes, the orchestrator repeats the verify->integrate
pipeline. Integration.md documents only the rebase/merge process itself.
```

### Step 7: Commit and Push

**Important:** Commit ALL files changed during this stage, not just the integration document.

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "claude-review(integrate): integration complete [session #$0]"
git push
```

Post to PR:
```bash
gh pr comment "claude/review/$0" --body "<integration summary -- conflicts resolved, ready for re-verification>"
```

### Step 8: Signal Transition

Signal `verify` to re-check that remediations survived the rebase:
```bash
echo "verify" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
```

## Important Notes

- **Always signal a transition:** write `done` (main hasn't moved) or `verify` (rebase happened) to `.next-stage`. The orchestrator re-runs the verify->integrate pipeline after a rebase to confirm remediations are intact.
- Use `--force-with-lease` (never `--force`) when pushing after rebase.
- If the rebase is hopelessly complex (many conflicts across many files), suggest to the user that a merge commit might be more appropriate, and ask how they want to proceed.
- This skill may be re-run multiple times if the PR stays open while main continues to move. Each run appends to Integration.md.

## Stage Transition Signal

When running under the `deep-review` orchestrator, you can request a transition to a different stage by writing the target stage name to `./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage`.

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Always write this file -- integrate must always signal its next stage
- The orchestrator validates your request -- invalid transitions are ignored

**When to signal:**
- `done` -- main has not moved, no integration was needed. Branch is ready to merge:
  ```bash
  echo "done" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
  ```
- `verify` -- rebase happened (main had new commits). Repeats the verify->integrate pipeline to confirm remediations survived the rebase:
  ```bash
  echo "verify" > ./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage
  ```

## Re-trigger Behavior

If re-triggered, append a new section:

```
---

## Re-integration (<date>)

### Reason
<main moved again / previous integration had issues>

### Changes on Main
...

### Conflicts and Resolution
...
```
