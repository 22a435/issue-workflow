# Update Tooling Phase

You are performing the **update-tooling** stage of a deep codebase review. Your job is to install user-approved tools and, where appropriate, persist them into the repository's setup scripts.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of a 9-stage deep review workflow orchestrated by the `deep-review` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/review/<session-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/<session-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to your own output document inside `./claude-reviews/$0/` (where `$0` is the session number passed as your argument). Never create files, directories, or write anywhere else under `./claude-reviews/` except your output document. When re-triggered, APPEND new sections -- never delete or overwrite existing content.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-review(<stage>): <description> [session #<N>]`. Commit and push after completing the stage.
- **PR updates:** Post a summary to the PR thread (via `gh pr comment`) after completing the stage.
- **Code changes allowed:** This stage MAY modify repo files outside `./claude-reviews/` -- specifically setup scripts, config files, and tool configuration. This is one of only two stages (along with remediation) that edits repo code.

## Context
- **Session number:** $0 (the review session number passed as your argument)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/$0/`
- **Input documents:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Interview.md`, `./claude-reviews/$0/Context.md`
- **Output document:** `./claude-reviews/$0/UpdateTooling.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read Input Documents

Read `Interview.md` for the list of approved tools, including:
- Which tools were approved
- Whether to persist each tool to the repo
- Any user-requested tools not in the original recommendations

Also read `Context.md` for the install/run commands and existing tooling already in the repo.

If `UpdateTooling.md` already exists (re-trigger), read it to see what was previously installed.

### Step 2: Check Existing Installations

For each approved tool, check if it is already installed:

```bash
command -v <tool-name> 2>/dev/null && echo "installed" || echo "not installed"
# or package-specific checks:
npm list -g <package> 2>/dev/null
pip show <package> 2>/dev/null
```

Skip tools that are already installed and at a compatible version.

### Step 3: Install Tools

For each tool that needs installation:

1. Install using the appropriate package manager:
   - npm/yarn/pnpm for JS tools
   - pip/pipx for Python tools
   - go install for Go tools
   - cargo install for Rust tools
   - brew/apt for system tools
   - Prefer global installs for CLI tools, dev dependencies for project-specific tools

2. Run a quick smoke test to verify it works:
   ```bash
   <tool> --version  # or --help, or a simple invocation
   ```

3. Record success or failure with version information.

### Step 4: Configure Tools (if needed)

Some tools need project-level configuration. For each:

- **Low risk** (CLI-only tools, no config needed): Install and done.
- **Medium risk** (adds config file like `.eslintrc`, `ruff.toml`): Create a minimal, reasonable config. Record what was created.
- **High risk** (modifies build pipeline, adds CI steps): Ask the user before proceeding. If the user already approved during interview, proceed; otherwise skip and document why.

### Step 5: Persist to Repo Setup

For tools marked for persistence in Interview.md:

1. **Check for existing setup scripts:** Look for `scripts/setup.sh`, `Makefile` setup targets, `package.json` scripts, `.devcontainer/`, etc.
2. **If setup scripts exist:** Add tool installation commands to the appropriate script.
3. **If no setup scripts exist:** Consider creating a lightweight setup approach (e.g., adding to `package.json` devDependencies, or `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies).
4. **Always add to `.claude/settings.json` or CLAUDE.md** if the tool should be available to future Claude sessions.

For tools NOT marked for persistence: install in the current environment only. No repo changes.

### Step 6: Write UpdateTooling.md

Write `./claude-reviews/$0/UpdateTooling.md`:

```
# Tooling Update: Review Session #<N>

## Summary
<N> tools installed, <N> already present, <N> failed.

## Tools Installed
| Tool | Version | Install Method | Persisted | Notes |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|-------|
| ruff | 0.4.1 | pip install ruff | yes (pyproject.toml) | |
| ...  | ...     | ...           | ...       | ...   |

## Tools Already Present
| Tool | Version | Location |
|------|---------|----------|
| eslint | 8.57.0 | node_modules/.bin/eslint |
| ...    | ...     | ...      |

## Tools Failed to Install
| Tool | Error | Suggested Workaround |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| ...  | ...   | ...                 |

## Configuration Created
| File | Tool | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| ruff.toml | ruff | Minimal config with default rules |
| ...  | ...  | ...         |

## Setup Script Updates
What was added to repo setup scripts, if anything. Include the exact changes made.

## Available Tool Commands
Quick reference for running each installed tool:
- `ruff check .` -- Python linter
- `npm audit` -- Dependency audit
- ...
```

### Step 7: Commit, Push, and Comment

Commit both the UpdateTooling.md and any repo changes (config files, setup script updates):

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "claude-review(update-tooling): install review tools [session #$0]"
git push
```

Post summary to PR:
```bash
gh pr comment "claude/review/$0" --body "**Update Tooling:** <N> tools installed, <N> already present, <N> failed. Persisted to repo: <list>."
```

## Stage Transition Signal

When running under the `deep-review` orchestrator, you can request a transition to a different stage by writing the target stage name to `./claude-reviews/$0/.next-stage`.

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Only write this file if you want a NON-DEFAULT transition
- If you do not write this file, the orchestrator advances to `interview` (default)
- The orchestrator validates your request -- invalid transitions are ignored

**When to signal:**
- Default (return to interview) is almost always correct -- the interview stage will confirm everything worked and continue to plan.

## Re-trigger Behavior

If re-triggered and `./claude-reviews/$0/UpdateTooling.md` already exists:

1. Read the existing UpdateTooling.md to see what was previously installed
2. Read the latest Interview.md for any newly approved tools
3. Only install tools not already present
4. Append a new section:

```

## Additional Tooling Update (triggered during <stage> phase)

### Reason
<what new tools were requested>

### New Tools Installed
| Tool | Version | Install Method | Persisted |
|------|---------|---------------|-----------|
| ...  | ...     | ...           | ...       |
```
