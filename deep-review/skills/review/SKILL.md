# Deep Review Phase

You are performing the **review** stage of a deep codebase review. This is the core stage of the workflow. Your job is to execute the review plan by running automated tools, launching parallel sub-reviewers, and compiling all findings into a comprehensive Review.md.

## Workflow Context

This skill is one stage of a 9-stage deep review workflow orchestrated by the `deep-review` CLI.

- **Branch:** `claude/review/<session-number>` (created by the orchestrator during setup)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/<session-number>/` -- each stage produces one document here
- **Sub-reviews directory:** `./claude-reviews/<session-number>/sub-reviews/` -- sub-reviewers write here
- **Document ownership:** You may READ any prior document. Only WRITE to `./claude-reviews/$0/Review.md` and files inside `./claude-reviews/$0/sub-reviews/`. Sub-reviewer agents may ONLY write to their own assigned file in `sub-reviews/`. The parent session writes `Review.md`.
- **Commits:** Format: `claude-review(<stage>): <description> [session #<N>]`. Commit and push after completing the stage.
- **PR updates:** Post the executive summary to the PR thread (via `gh pr comment`) after completing the stage.
- **Subagent cost optimization:** All sub-reviewer agents use `model: "sonnet"` -- they are performing analysis and pattern-matching. The parent session (this one, on opus) handles synthesis, cross-referencing, severity judgments, and writing Review.md.
- **No code edits:** This stage does NOT edit any source code. It only produces review documents. The remediation stage handles code changes.

## Context
- **Session number:** $0 (the review session number passed as your argument)
- **Work directory:** `./claude-reviews/$0/`
- **Input documents:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Plan.md` (primary), plus Context.md, Interview.md, UpdateTooling.md
- **Output documents:** `./claude-reviews/$0/Review.md`, `./claude-reviews/$0/sub-reviews/*.md`

## Instructions

### Step 1: Read the Plan

Read `Plan.md` in full. This defines:
- Which sub-reviewers to launch
- What tools to run
- The scope and focus for each sub-reviewer
- Review priorities

Also read `Context.md` for project context and `UpdateTooling.md` for available tools and their commands.

### Step 2: Run Automated Tools

Execute all automated tools listed in the plan. Capture their output for sub-reviewers to consume:

```bash
mkdir -p ./claude-reviews/$0/sub-reviews/.tool-output
```

For each tool in the plan's "Automated Tool Runs" table:
```bash
<tool-command> > ./claude-reviews/$0/sub-reviews/.tool-output/<tool-name>.json 2>&1
# or .txt if the tool doesn't support JSON output
```

If a tool fails to run, record the error and continue with other tools. Sub-reviewers can proceed with manual analysis even without tool output.

### Step 3: Launch Parallel Sub-Reviewers

Launch sub-reviewer agents **in parallel** as defined in Plan.md. Each sub-reviewer is an Agent with `model: "sonnet"`.

**Sub-reviewer prompt template** (adapt for each reviewer):

```
You are the <NAME> sub-reviewer for deep review session #<N> of <repo>.
Your task is to examine the entire codebase and produce a thorough <NAME> review.

## Project Context
<Summary from Context.md -- tech stack, architecture, key patterns>

## Your Scope
<From Plan.md -- specific focus areas, directories, exclusions>

## Tools and Data Available
<Paths to relevant tool output files in sub-reviews/.tool-output/>
<Commands you can run for additional analysis>

## Review Priorities
<From Interview.md -- what matters most to the user>

## Instructions
<Sub-reviewer-specific analysis instructions from Plan.md>

Examine the ENTIRE codebase within your scope, not just recent changes. This is a comprehensive review.

## Output Format
Write your findings to ./claude-reviews/<N>/sub-reviews/<name>.md with this exact structure:

# <Name> Review: Session #<N>

## Summary
Brief overview of findings and overall assessment for this domain.

## Findings

### Finding 1: <descriptive title>
- **Severity:** critical / important / suggestion / info
- **Location:** file:line (or module/component if broader)
- **Description:** What was found and why it matters
- **Recommendation:** Specific action to take
- **Effort:** trivial / small / medium / large
- **Category:** <sub-category within this domain>

### Finding 2: ...
(continue for all findings)

## Statistics
- Files examined: <N>
- Findings: <N> critical, <N> important, <N> suggestion, <N> info
- Tools used: <list of tools whose output was consumed>

## Areas Needing Further Investigation
<Anything that was suspicious but inconclusive, requiring deeper analysis or a different sub-reviewer's perspective. Be specific about WHAT to investigate and WHY.>

IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:
- Write ONLY to ./claude-reviews/<N>/sub-reviews/<name>.md
- Do NOT edit any source code files
- Do NOT write to any other file under ./claude-reviews/
- Do NOT write to Review.md -- that is the parent session's responsibility
```

**Parallelization:** Launch all sub-reviewers in a single batch if possible. If Claude Code limits concurrent agents, launch in two waves of 5.

### Step 4: Monitor and Extend

After all sub-reviewers complete, read every sub-review file. Check the "Areas Needing Further Investigation" section of each.

For areas that need follow-up:
- Launch targeted follow-up agents (`model: "sonnet"`) to investigate specific concerns
- Follow-up agents APPEND to the existing sub-review file (add a clearly marked section)
- Follow-up template:
  ```
  ---

  ## Follow-up Investigation

  ### Investigated: <what was looked into>
  ### Findings: <what was discovered>
  ```

If a sub-reviewer produced results that conflict with another sub-reviewer's findings, investigate the conflict and record the resolution in Review.md.

### Step 5: Compile Review.md

Synthesize ALL sub-review findings into a single comprehensive `./claude-reviews/$0/Review.md`. This is the core deliverable.

**Structure:**

```
# Deep Review: Session #<N>

## Executive Summary
High-level assessment of the codebase. Overall health rating (Excellent / Good / Fair / Needs Attention / Critical).
Key strengths and most pressing concerns in 3-5 bullet points.

## Statistics
- Sub-reviews completed: <N>/10
- Total findings: <N> (<N> critical, <N> important, <N> suggestion, <N> info)
- Tools run: <list>
- Files examined: <N> (estimated across all sub-reviewers)

## Critical Findings
Aggregated from all sub-reviews. Deduplicated. Cross-referenced across domains.
For each:
- **Title:** descriptive
- **Source:** which sub-reviewer(s) identified this
- **Location:** file:line or module
- **Description:** full context
- **Recommendation:** specific fix
- **Effort:** estimated
- **Cross-cutting:** does this affect other domains? how?

## Important Findings
Same format as Critical.

## Suggestions
Same format, can be more concise.

## Informational
Brief list of observations that don't require action.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
Findings that span multiple sub-review domains. For example:
- A security issue that is also an architecture concern
- A testing gap that relates to a documentation gap
- A dependency issue that affects performance

## Complex Items for Separate Issues
Items that are too complex for immediate remediation, involve tradeoffs the developer should decide, or require broader team discussion. Each should become a GitHub issue.
For each:
- **Title:** proposed issue title
- **Description:** what needs to be done and why
- **Context:** relevant findings that inform this
- **Suggested labels:** bug/enhancement/security/documentation
- **Priority:** high/medium/low
- **Estimated effort:** small/medium/large

## Sub-Review Summaries
Brief summary of each sub-reviewer's assessment. Reference the full sub-review file for details.

| Sub-Reviewer | Findings | Health | Full Report |
|-------------|----------|--------|-------------|
| Security | 2 critical, 1 important | Needs Attention | sub-reviews/security.md |
| Code Quality | 0 critical, 3 important | Good | sub-reviews/code-quality.md |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

## Prioritized Remediation Recommendations
Ordered list of what to fix first, considering:
- Severity (critical first)
- Effort (quick wins first within same severity)
- Dependencies (fix foundations before dependent code)
- User priorities (from interview)
```

### Step 6: Commit and Push

Commit both Review.md and all sub-review files:

```bash
git add ./claude-reviews/$0/Review.md ./claude-reviews/$0/sub-reviews/
git commit -m "claude-review(review): comprehensive review complete [session #$0]"
git push
```

### Step 7: Comment on PR

Post the Executive Summary to the PR thread:

```bash
gh pr comment "claude/review/$0" --body "**Deep Review Complete**

<executive summary>

**Statistics:** <N> findings (<N> critical, <N> important, <N> suggestion, <N> info)

See \`claude-reviews/$0/Review.md\` for the full review."
```

## Stage Transition Signal

**Rules:**
- Write exactly one stage name, nothing else
- Only write this file if you want a NON-DEFAULT transition
- If you do not write this file, the orchestrator advances to `remediation-plan` (default)

**When to signal:**
- `review` -- if follow-up investigation revealed significant new areas to review (self-loop for a fresh comprehensive pass). Should be rare.
- Default (advance to remediation-plan) is correct in most cases.

## Re-trigger Behavior

If re-triggered:

1. Read existing Review.md and all sub-reviews
2. Identify what changed since the last review (new tools installed, scope changes, etc.)
3. Re-run only the affected sub-reviewers
4. Append to Review.md:

```

## Re-review (triggered during <stage> phase)

### Reason
<what changed>

### Updated Findings
<new or revised findings>

### Updated Statistics
